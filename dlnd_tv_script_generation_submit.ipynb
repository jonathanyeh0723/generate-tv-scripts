    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Architecture:\n",
    "  - For this project selection of model architecture, I choose LSTM, because comparing to RNN that the context is preserved from timestamp to timestamp which can be useful, but that might get lost in longer sentences; LSTM, however, have cell state like a conveyor belts carrying contexts all the way down for a long way down timestamp. This way, I think it would be more efficient and effective to use LSTM in such task like generating TV scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hyperparameters:\n",
    "  - According to lesson 4 - Hyperparameters, we can know that:\n",
    "   - A hyperparameter is a variable that we need to set before applying a learning algorithm to a dataset.\n",
    "   - The challenge with hyperparameters is that there are no magic numbers that work everywhere. The best numbers depend on each task and each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we get to the answer? Frankly speaking, there is no shortcut. We can only learn by trial and error. However, there are already some useful tips provided throughout this course so we can nudge to our target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we can break hyperparameters down into two categories:\n",
    " - Optimizer Hyperparameters: These are the variables related more to the optimization and training process than to the model itself. These include the learning rate, the mini batch size, and the number of training iterations (or epochs).\n",
    " - Model Hyperparameters: These are the variables that are more involved in the structure of the model. These include the number of layers, hidden units, and model specific hyperparameters for architectures, like RNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following on the mentor’s suggestions listed below, we can quickly grab some as a starting point.\n",
    " - Learning Rate: 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001\n",
    " - Batch Size: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512\n",
    " - Number of Training Iterations: Usually we can start by setting epochs between 5 to 10, and then kick off the experiment. Once the training is started, we can monitor whether the loss is converged or not. If it does then it’s a good sign. If it doesn’t, then maybe we should try tune other optimizer or model parameters and come back retrain later. The ultimate goal is to have the model train for as many epochs or iterations that it takes, as long as the validation error keeps decreasing.\n",
    " - Sequence Length: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50\n",
    " - Embedding Dimension: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500\n",
    " - Hidden Units: 128, 256, 512, 1024\n",
    " - Number of Layers: 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary size should be set to the length of the variable ‘vocab_to_int’, and the corresponding output size must also be aligned otherwise we may encounter error since the input and output shape does not match.\n",
    "\n",
    "I remembered from scratch I randomly picked some data to begin with 5 epochs training. Watch the training loss. Fine tune the parameters till the loss is decreased. And then gradually enlarge the epochs from 5 to 20 to see if I can get better outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging part for me is to adjust the sequence length and embedding dimension. It basically depends on datasets and the task we want to solve. Therefore, there is no one size fits all standard. On the contrast, it would be easier to tune number of hidden units and layers, since most cases we can improve the model accuracy by increasing them.\n"
